## Job description

Postdoc/tenure track position on Neuroscience-inspired Intelligent Autonomous
Agents

### Academic environment
Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) is one of Europe's top technological
universities, situated in the heart of one of Europe's largest high-tech
innovation ecosystems. Research at TU/e is characterized by a combination of
academic excellence and a strong real-world impact. This impact is often
obtained via close collaboration with high-tech industries. TU/e consistently
achieves a global top position in university-industry collaboration rankings,
and is a breeding ground for spinoff and startup companies.

### BIASlab

Within TU/e, [BIASlab](http://biaslab.org) (Bayesian Autonomous Intelligent
Systems Lab), headed by [prof. Bert de
Vries](https://biaslab.github.io/member/bert/), seeks to advance the state of
the art in Artificial Intelligence beyond the current focus on deep learning. We
aim to develop intelligent autonomous agents that learn purposeful behavior
through situated environmental interactions by exploiting advanced neuroscience
insights and theories. Our approach to the design of intelligent agents is
inspired by the [Free Energy
Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_energy_principle), which is a
computational theory of self-organization in biological systems (particularly
the brain). In short, we aim to develop synthetic active-inference agents that
can be utilized for engineering applications. Ultimately, we want to use these
agents to automate the development of novel signal processing algorithms under
in-situ conditions, e.g., for quantified-self applications in hearables and
other wearables.

### The position

It is expected that the candidate takes on a leading role within BIASlab,
working together with PhD students, the project PI and international colleagues.
Key areas of interest include Bayesian machine learning, computational
neurosciences and signal processing. Different contractual options (contract
duration, tenure track options, etc.) can be discussed, depending on the
candidate's background and interests. Job requirements

* You should have a PhD degree in electrical engineering, computer science, computational neuroscience or similar.
* We want to develop working agents and consequently put a high value on candidates with a strong record in (scientific) programming and in translating advanced theories into practical applications.
* Preferably experience in supervising MSc and/or PhD students.
* It is essential to have a good written and spoken command of English.
* Finally, we appreciate a team player attitude, willingness to work hard and know how to have fun at it.

## Conditions of employment

We offer the following:

* An appointment (1 FTE) as a postdoc for 3 to 4 years with flexible starting date, but preferably as soon as possible. For exceptionally qualified candidates a tenure-track appointment can be considered.
* Gross monthly salary in accordance with the Collective Labor Agreement of the Dutch Universities, scale 10. Exact salary depends on your experience.
* An attractive package of fringe benefits, including excellent work facilities, end-of-year allowance and sports facilities.
* A dynamic, challenging and ambitious research environment with an eye for optimizing the work vs private life balance.
