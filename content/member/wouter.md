I am interested in robots, brains and robotbrains. I'm fascinated by [intelligent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence) behaviour: how animals can efficiently process a flood of sensory signals and learn to take actions that keep them alive. I'm passionate about taking what we know from [how brains process information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_neuroscience), to making [intelligent machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence).

\

My work in the lab revolves around improving the efficiency of the inference process. We aim to allow individual nodes in an agent's [factor graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_graph) to decide for themselves if they will communicate a signal forward, based on how much the message would reduce [free energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_energy_principle).

Previous research includes studying the limits of generalizing to data from other distributions ([domain adaptation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_adaptation)) and model selection under covariate shift ([cross-validation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)#Limitations_and_misuse)). Mainly, I designed and analyzed maximum-likelihood, minimax and minimum-variance estimators, which are applied to problems in [image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_image_processing), [signal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal_processing) and [natural language processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing).
