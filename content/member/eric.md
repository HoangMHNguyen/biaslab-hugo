Quan (Eric) Nguyen received a M.Sc. in Computer Science (with a specialization in Algorithms, Data Analytics and Machine Learning; and a minor in Statistics, both with distinction) from the University of Helsinki in 2015.

He is interested in developing intelligent systems that can do human jobs with a little help from humans by learning from the experience, and adapting to new situations. Since the old experience is often a tiny and far from perfect representation of the unknown future, the key is to decide which is significant and relevant for future problems rather than to rely completely on the past. This small piece of experience (compared to the complicated real word), however is often too big for most of systems to handle in real time.

He believes these issues have been well studied separately for decades by the two old and wealthy neighbors: statistics and mathematical optimization. His research is mainly to "steal" their classic but plain good ideas and put them together in modern problems.
