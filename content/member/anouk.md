Anouk van Diepen received her M.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering from the TU Eindhoven in 2017. Currently she is a PhD candidate in the the Electrical Engineering department of [TU Eindhoven](http://www.tue.nl), working in the [BIASlab](http://biaslab.org) team. Her research focuses on sparse Bayesian learning for beamforming in hearing aids. She is also interested in in-situ trainable gesture recognition.
