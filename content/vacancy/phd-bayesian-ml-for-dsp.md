## Job description

This research program is aimed at developing modern machine learning methods
that lead to improved design of signal processing algorithms, e.g., for audio
processing or quantified-self applications. Specifically, in our approach we
study computational models of learning and adaptation in brains and apply these
ideas to the design of artificial intelligent agents that learn to design
(signal processing) algorithms from in-situ interactions with their environment.
Key areas of interest include Bayesian machine learning, computational
neurosciences and signal processing. Please browse our [web
page](http://biaslab.org) for more information on our research goals.

## Job requirements

- You should have a Master's degree in electrical engineering, computer science
  or similar with excellent grades.

- You will develop code for simulating machine learning experiments and we put a
  high value on candidates with a strong record in (scientific) programming.

- It will be essential to have a good written and spoken command of English.

- Finally, we appreciate a team player attitude, willingness to work hard and
  know how to have fun at it.

## Conditions of employment

- A challenging job for 4 years in a dynamic and ambitious university and a
  stimulating research environment; Support with your professional and personal
  development;

- A gross salary per month of € 2222,- (first year) as a PhD up to € 2840,-
  (final year) in accordance with the Collective Labor Agreement of the Dutch
  Universities

- 8% holiday allowance

- 8.3% end of the year allowance.

- An extensive package of fringe benefits (e.g. excellent technical
  infrastructure, on-campus child care, and excellent sports facilities.
