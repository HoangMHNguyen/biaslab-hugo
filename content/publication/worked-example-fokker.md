abstract = "Abstract. The Free Energy Principle (FEP) and its corollary active inference describe a complex theoretical framework with a substantial statistical mechanics foundation that is often expressed in terms of the Fokker-Planck equation. Easy-to-follow examples of this formalism are scarce, leaving a high barrier of entry to the field. In this paper we provide a worked example of an active inference agent as a hierarchical Gaussian generative model. We proceed to write its equations of motion explicitly as a Fokker-Planck equation, providing a clear mapping between theoretical accounts of FEP and practical implementation.
